# {System}Verilog
This is my System Verilog learning projects.

What is System Verilog : <br>
SystemVerilog is a hardware description and verification language (HDVL) used in the design and verification of digital circuits, particularly in the development of ASICs and FPGAs.

I use Vivado 2018.2 for build this projects.
